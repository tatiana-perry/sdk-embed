# sdk-embed

## To Do:
* Deploying to heroku returns a $PORT error. Maybe adding a [weboack.prod.config](https://github.com/BabuBahir/react-node-example/blob/master/webpack.prod.config.js) then updating the scripts to run production should fix it.
* Getting the following errors when running locally:
`Refused to display 'https://tatiana.fun/embedded-checkout' in a frame because an ancestor violates the following Content Security Policy directive: "frame-ancestors https://localhost".`
